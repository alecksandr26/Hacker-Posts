# Hacker Post
This a reactjs project that I made where you can create simple posts
## The url of the webapp in heroku
[The webapp](https://hackerpost.herokuapp.com)
## Getting Started
First you need to create a "react app" so you will need to have installed "nodejs" and "npm".
[For windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows)
[For linux](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04/)
After that make sure that you have "npx" for that you can run this another command.
```
$ npx --version
```
And with that the last step is to run this another command, to create the project folder and to install all the react modules.
```
$ npx create-react-app hackerpost
```
Move to the project folder.
```
$ cd hackerpost
```
You will need this to install this dependency from react called "react-router-dom".
```
$ npm install react-router-dom
```
And with that you can start the development server, you only need to run this command.
```
$ npm start
```
